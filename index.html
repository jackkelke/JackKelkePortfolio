This drawing tought me how to break up large drawings into smaller manageable parts to make the large picture. This project took me about a week to draw and greatly improved my understanding of shading with multiple different types of pencils. This is one of my most favorite projects I have completed so far. Cars are potentially my absolute favorite thing to draw and being able to bring them from real life to my paper brings me a great deal of joy.</p>

This project, like most of my other drawings, took me a very long time to complete. Trying to capture every bit of detail was super difficult but payed off in the end. I love the way you can see New York City, especially the Statue of Liberty in the reflection of his goggles. This was supposed to symbolize the ultimate sacrafice, a Pilot risking his life for his country's Freedom. I think this drawing came out really great and im very happy with how it looks.  </p>

This was a covid project while I, like many, was trapped at home. I really wanted to make something I can display on my shelf that looked awesome, and what looks cooler than an octopus! I carefully carved out the image onto the vase, I had lightly traced in pensil the outline of the octopus to help with the accuracy while carving. This project earned me a silver key in the schoolastic art fair in 2020 and tought me alot about clay work and how meticulus it can be. </p>

                            <p>This charcoal drawing help introduce me to the basics of charcoal drawing along with furthering my understanding of shading. This was my first attempt at ever drawing in charcoal, and I had a ton of fun and really learned how messy it can be! This project helped me incorperate important routine into my everyday drawings, like placing a mat below my hand to be sure to protect against smearing. This project took a great deal of time along with my others, especially because it was a gift for my sister who is largely into records, hence the idea for the project. This is supposed to represent an old record player with a horn that plays the sound, but this one is a flower. I think it came out awesome and was a great idea.</p>

I think this project came out the best of any other, while its not supposed to be highly detailed and display more of the pastel strokes, I think it is a great style. This image was originally a painting that inspired me to draw something similar with pastels. This was my first pastel project and definately makes me want to return to this medium. I love the shading and being able to use colors that you wouldn't expect to be there, but work perfectly. This project really showed me how to use unsespecting colors in transitions and how you may not realize a color is there, but in reality, so many coexist in an image and our minds blend them together. </p>

                            <p> A deep passion of mine is old german cars, the Porsches, the BMWs, and the Volkswagens, I love the boxy styling of these 80's cars and I really enjoy imagining what they could look like with my own spin on it. Here is my 1983 Volkswagen GTI I purchased to overhaul with my own style, particularly a wide body kit and some new color.

                            <p> Here is the first step I took in designing my custom wide body kit, 3D scanning. 3D scanning allowed me to get perfect dimensional accuracy while designing my kit. This was critical when it came to 3D modeling. This took place in my garage and took many attempts but I was eventually able to get a perfect mesh that I could inport to my modeling software. 3D scanning was pretty difficult but I deeply believe this is a very valuable skill to posses in the field of automotive design.   </p>

While the design took quite a few days to complete it was well worth it. This step helped teach me alot about using the application Fusion360, a very valuable tool for any designer. I used the forms application within fusion to help make the dynamic shapes and fit them to the car for a percise fit. </p>

The ability to prototype and test versions was great.

                            <p>The Final Product! This took countless hours and so much post processing but the final result is something I would not of believed I was capable of. I completely brought this project from my mind to reality in a few months. So many skills were learned during this project and I cannot wait to do it again and even better than before. Not only did I learn a bunch of new skills like 3D scanning, printing, and modeling, I learned about how im going to do it better next time. </p>
